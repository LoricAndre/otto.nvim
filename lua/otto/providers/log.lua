-- The log of a session, which providers build from what happened, the same way from their session files and their
-- processes. A turn starts with what the agent does after the last one ended, and ends when the agent settles while it
-- runs, when a prompt follows its answer, or at the end of the session file. So every turn ends. What the transcript
-- doesn't show, like the session's name, goes to the state instead
